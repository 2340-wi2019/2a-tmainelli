<h1>The Wizard of OZ!</h1>

<p>
 <strong><span id="female1_01"></span></strong> lived in the midst of the great
 <strong><span id="state1_01"></span></strong>
 <strong><span id="geo1_01"></span></strong>, with Uncle
 <strong><span id="male1_01"></span></strong>, who was a 
 <strong><span id="occupation1_01"></span></strong>, and Aunt
 <strong><span id="female2_01"></span></strong>, who was a farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried
 by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking
 <strong><span id="noun1_01"></span></strong>, a
 <strong><span id="noun2_01"></span></strong> for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and beds. Uncle
 <strong><span id="male1_02"></span></strong> and Aunt
 <strong><span id="female2_02"></span></strong> had a big bed in one corner, and
 <strong><span id="female1_02"></span></strong> a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar-except a small hole
 dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush 
 any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the 
 <strong><span id="noun3_01"></span></strong>, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.
</p>

<p>
  When
  <strong><span id="female1_03"></span></strong> stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great 
  <strong><span id="color1_01"></span></strong>
  <strong><span id="geo1_02"></span></strong> on evey side. Not a 
  <strong><span id="noun4_01"></span></strong> nor a 
  <strong><span id="noun5_01"></span></strong> broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. 
  The sun had baked the plowed land into a 
  <strong><span id="color1_02"></span></strong> mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had 
  burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same 
  <strong><span id="color1_03"></span></strong> color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint 
  and the rains washed it away, and now the house was a dull and 
  <strong><span id="color1_04"></span></strong> as everything else.
